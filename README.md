# AI Classification Driver Behavior Model by CNN Method

This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify driver behavior based on the provided dataset. The application has been deployed for easy access and interaction.

## Dataset Source

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:

[Revitsone 5-Class Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robinreni/revitsone-5class)

## Deployment

The model has been deployed as a web application using Streamlit. You can interact with the application at the following link:

[Driver Behavior Classification App](https://driverbehavier.streamlit.app/)

## Features

- **Model:** Built using CNN for high-accuracy classification.
- **Dataset:** Pre-processed and labeled for 5 classes of driver behavior.
- **Web App:** Simple and user-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing predictions.

## How to Use
1. Fork Repository and ReDeploy model to your streamlits [Streamlit](https://share.streamlit.io/)
2. Upload an image of a driver.
3. View the predicted driver behavior.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras for building the CNN model
- Streamlit for web application deployment
